![my first icon](\assets\images\2020\icon-made-on-2020-01-06.png)

Today I made my icon for my website today. I am back at university today. It is not a great icon but it did not take much time and do not have much skill. I wish I was a better digital artist. I was tempted to make it  Adenine, but I could not draw that well. I will add the image of Adenine to home page.
